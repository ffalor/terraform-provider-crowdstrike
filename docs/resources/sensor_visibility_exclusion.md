## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create a sensor visibility exclusion for a temporary directory
resource "crowdstrike_sensor_visibility_exclusion" "temp_exclusion" {
  value   = "/tmp/*"
  comment = "Exclude temporary directory from sensor visibility"
}

# Create a sensor visibility exclusion for a specific application
resource "crowdstrike_sensor_visibility_exclusion" "app_exclusion" {
  value                          = "/opt/myapp/bin/*"
  comment                        = "Exclude myapp binaries from sensor visibility"
  apply_to_descendant_processes  = true
}

# Create a sensor visibility exclusion for specific host groups
resource "crowdstrike_sensor_visibility_exclusion" "group_exclusion" {
  value       = "C:\\MyApp\\*"
  comment     = "Exclude MyApp directory for development hosts"
  host_groups = ["development-hosts", "staging-hosts"]
